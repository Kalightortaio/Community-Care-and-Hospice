Developed from February 2019 - April 2019

Description: A commercial website designed to advertise my clientâ€™s medical business and to help connect patients to their primary care. Written in python, I used django for my backend, and focused on making the navigation of the site very responsive and easy to use. Later on in the project, I worked alongside another developer to produce the mobile version of the website based on my designs.

Environment: HTML, CSS, Python, Django, JavaScript, & JQuery.
